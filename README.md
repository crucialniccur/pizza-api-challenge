}
Response: Created RestaurantPizza or error if validation fails.

Validation Rules
RestaurantPizza.price must be between 1 and 30 (enforced both at the database and application levels).

POST /restaurant_pizzas requires price, restaurant_id, and pizza_id.

Returns 400 for missing fields or invalid price.

Returns 404 if the specified restaurant or pizza does not exist.

Testing with Postman
Import the challenge-1-pizzas.postman_collection.json into Postman.

Ensure the server is running (flask run).

Run the collection to test all routes.

Verify:

GET /restaurants returns a list of restaurants.

GET /restaurants/<id> works with valid and invalid IDs.

DELETE /restaurants/<id> deletes the restaurant and associated RestaurantPizza records.

GET /pizzas returns a list of pizzas.

POST /restaurant_pizzas works with valid data and returns errors for invalid data (e.g., price > 30).
